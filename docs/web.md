description: An inspired interpretation of HP's design language — a white-paper enterprise-consumer system anchored by HP Electric Blue (`#024ad8`) as the lone signal CTA, near-black ink (`#1a1a1a`) for headlines, geometric Forma-DJR sans throughout, and angular blue-chevron decorations that nod to the HP wordmark's slashes. Cards round at 8–16px, photos sit in soft 16px frames, and dark navy slabs anchor the customer-story and "how can we help" closing bands.

## Scope

This is the shared visual design language for every web page `dgs` serves — the
GPX map page and any page added later. It is a reference for tokens, components
and layout rules; per-app page behaviour stays in `docs/apps/<app>/`.

## The shared module

The tokens, page frame and controls below live in one place: `internal/webui`,
embedded in the binary and mounted by every server that serves a page, under
`/ui/`. A page links `/ui/tokens.css`, `/ui/base.css` and `/ui/controls.css`,
then adds a stylesheet of its own for what only it draws — the graph canvas,
the map workspace.

The module also carries the one interaction no page should write twice: the
**file dialog**. A page links `/ui/filedialog.css`, imports `openFile` or
`saveFile` from `/ui/filedialog.js`, and mounts the endpoints
`internal/webfile` serves under `/ui/files/` — `dir`, one folder's folders and
files, and `places`, the list down the dialog's side. A page that saves mounts
them with `Writable`, which adds the three a save needs: `taken`, whether a
name is already there and what of; `folder`, one new folder; and `rename`. A
page that only opens leaves `Writable` off, and then nothing the dialog can
reach changes anything on disk. The computation behind all of them is
`internal/filebrowse`, so a TUI file view lists a folder with the same code.

It also carries the **file tree**: a set of slash-separated paths drawn as
nested folders, folders first, each row with an outline folder or file icon
and its name in the monospace face, and a hairline down every open folder so
depth reads at a glance. A click on a folder opens or shuts it. A page links
`/ui/filetree.css`, imports `fileTree` from `/ui/filetree.js` and passes the
files with what only it knows: which row is picked, what a click on a file
does or where it links, a short note drawn at the right of a row, and a
green check after the name of a file that is already taken in. The tree draws
and reports clicks; what a row means stays with the page.

It also carries the **splitter**: the hairline between two panes that the
reader drags to resize them. A page puts a `.splitter.col` or `.splitter.row`
beside the pane and calls `splitter` from `/ui/splitter.js` with a minimum, a
maximum and a storage key of its own, so the size is remembered per browser.

It also carries the **status bar**: the one row along the bottom of a page
where every piece of news lands. A page links `/ui/statusbar.css`, imports
`/ui/statusbar.js`, calls `mount()` once and then `show`, `showError`,
`setState`, `setSummary`, `setHints` and `clear`. It is the web half of the
TUI shell's status bar and carries the same three regions — state on the left,
the middle, hints on the right — so a reader looks in one place whichever face
of `dgs` they are using. The three are grid columns, and the middle is its own
column between the two ends, so what it says stays centred on the row whatever
the ends hold.

Two things want that middle, and it holds one line at a time. `setSummary`
writes the standing line: what the page is showing, or what the tool in hand
does now, such as what a click on the map would do. It is the one part that
may carry `<strong>` and `<kbd>`, because a key is named as a key. `show`
writes the news over it. News wins while it is the newest thing the reader has
been told; the summary comes back when the news is cleared, or when the
summary itself changes, because a summary changing means the reader has just
done something else. Like the top bar it is exactly one row and never
wraps: a message longer than the row is cut with an ellipsis and kept whole in
its title.

It is thinner than the top bar — `--status-height`, not `--bar-height` — and
set in `--font-size-xs`. A terminal cannot draw a row shorter than a character
cell; a browser can, and the bar holds text and nothing to click, so it gives
the height back to the page. The state on the left is set in small capitals,
which reads as a label rather than as news and tells the two apart at a
glance. Its two ends are held further in from the sides than the top bar's,
because a browser window is rounded at the bottom and text at the very edge of
the last row is cut by the corner.

What belongs there is a one-off event: what was saved, renamed or refused. The
lasting state of one thing — a track whose sidecar would not read, a route leg
that would not route — stays beside that thing, where it can carry its own
*Retry*. A message is not taken away after a while, because the reader may
have been looking elsewhere when it arrived; the next message replaces it.

It also carries the **context menu**: the small list of commands a right click
opens on the thing under the pointer. A page links `/ui/menu.css`, imports
`openMenu` from `/ui/menu.js`, and calls it with the `contextmenu` event and a
list of sections. A section is a list of items — a label, a title, what to do,
and whether the item is disabled or destructive — and sections are drawn with
a rule between them, so commands of one kind sit together. An empty section is
left out, so a page builds its sections from what is there without counting
first. Only one menu is open at a time; it closes on a choice, on a click
elsewhere, on `Esc`, on scroll and on resize, and it flips back inside the
window near an edge. A menu offers nothing that is not also reachable without
it: it is a shortcut to the row's own actions, never the only way to one.

The dialog is what a reader already knows from Finder and Explorer:

- Places down the side — the folder `dgs` opened at when it is not the home
  directory, *Home*, the folders under it a document is likely to be in, and,
  on macOS, each mounted volume. Only folders that are there are listed, and
  the one being browsed is marked.
- One size, whatever is in the folder: a share of the window — 68% of its
  width, 72% of its height, within a floor and a ceiling — not a size the
  contents decide. A folder of three files and a folder of three hundred draw
  the same dialog. Everything inside gives way to it: the rows that do not fit
  scroll, a long message from the page scrolls after a few lines, and a deep
  path is cut to one line rather than wrapping. The dialog is never taller
  than the window, because a dialog whose top is off the screen cannot be
  cancelled.
- The corner **drags it to another size**, and that size is kept for the next
  dialog, as the sort order and the hidden-file toggle are. A reader who wants
  a taller listing says so once.
- A bar over the listing: `↑` to the folder above, the full path, and `↻`.
- Three columns — *Name*, *Date Modified*, *Size*. Clicking a heading sorts by
  it, clicking it again turns the order round, marked `^` or `v`. A name sorts
  the way it reads, so `2` comes before `10`. Folders stay above files, and
  the choice is kept for the next dialog.
- A **filter** over the file types, named by the page: `GPX files`, `All
  files`. Folders are listed whatever the filter, because the dialog browses
  through them. Beside it, a *Hidden files* toggle, also kept between dialogs.
- Keys as a file manager answers them: the arrows move the selection, Right
  steps into a folder, Left or Backspace goes up, typing jumps to the row whose
  name starts that way, Enter confirms, Esc cancels. Double-clicking a folder
  opens it; double-clicking a file confirms.
- One action button, and Cancel. Clicking a folder marks where the reader is,
  to step into or rename; it is never what an open answers, so the button stays
  off until a file is marked, unless the page asked for a folder. Opening
  answers one path, or several when the page asks for several — Shift extends the selection, Cmd or Ctrl adds one
  row. Saving answers the folder being browsed and the name that was typed.
  The dialog only chooses a path: writing it stays the server's work.

Saving adds what a save dialog has and an open dialog does not:

- A **name field** under the listing. Clicking a file puts its name there, so
  writing over a file is picking it. A name is one entry of the folder being
  browsed: a name holding `/` or `\` is refused rather than followed.
- The **filter's extension** is added when the name was typed without one, and
  changing the filter changes the extension with it — the name stays, the type
  follows the choice.
- **New Folder** in the bar. The name is typed on a row of its own at the top
  of the listing, where the folder will be. A name already taken is refused:
  nothing is replaced or merged.
- **F2** renames the one row that is selected, in place. It stays in its
  folder, and a name already taken is refused, so renaming never replaces
  anything. Enter commits, Esc gives up without cancelling the dialog.
- A name that is **already a file** is confirmed — *Replace the file?* — before
  it is answered. A name that is already a **folder** is refused outright: a
  save never replaces a folder. A page whose server will not write over a file
  turns the confirmation off, and then a name already taken is refused too: the
  dialog never answers a path the write would be refused for.

Two rules keep the module worth having:

- A page never re-declares a shared token and never hard-codes a value a token
  carries. A test walks every stylesheet `dgs` serves and fails on a `var(--x)`
  that `tokens.css` does not declare and the page does not declare itself.
- A page declares a token of its own only for something no other page has —
  the purple the GPX page marks hand-removed points with. When a second page
  wants it, it moves into `tokens.css`.

Every page `dgs` serves is light only. The system has one surface vocabulary,
and a second set of values for a dark one is not part of it.


## Overview

HP reads like a long-running consumer-electronics catalog crossed with an enterprise-software product page. The whole system sits on **pure white** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`) with thin gray panels (`{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}`) for alternating section bands. There is one chromatic action color — **HP Electric Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — `#024ad8`) — and one ink color (`{colors.ink}` — `#1a1a1a`); together they do ninety percent of the work. Type is a single family across every surface: **Forma DJR Micro**, HP's bespoke geometric grotesque, set at weight 500 for headlines and 400 for body — clean, neutral, slightly mechanical.

The signature gesture is **angular blue chevrons** — sharp 0-radius slashes derived from the HP wordmark's pair of parallel slashes — that anchor the homepage hero, the laptop-page hero, and the printer pricing page. They appear on the left and right edges of the primary banner card, layered behind product photography. Outside those decorative slashes, every other surface is rectilinear with **soft 8–16px corners** on cards and a 4px corner on buttons.

The system breaks into three voice modes: a **white commercial body** for product browsing (cards, category icons, pricing tiers); a **dark navy slab** (`{colors.ink}` near-black) for testimonial bands, the closing "How can we help?" footer-prelude, and the page footer; and a **light fog band** (`{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}`) for utility sections like comparison strips and FAQ accordions. The blue accent appears only on filled CTAs, link text, the chevron decorations, and the active price-stamp on a featured tier — never as a section background.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pure white canvas (`{colors.canvas}`) with deep ink (`{colors.ink}`) running every body surface; light fog bands (`{colors.cloud}`, `{colors.fog}`) alternate for section rhythm
- HP Electric Blue (`{colors.primary}`) is the lone CTA fill and link color; it appears at most twice per viewport
- Bespoke Forma DJR Micro across every surface — display, body, button, caption — at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700
- Cards round at `{rounded.xl}` (16px) for product/pricing tiles; buttons sit at `{rounded.md}` (4px) with capitalize labels
- Geometric blue chevrons (`{colors.primary}` rectangles cut at 45°) frame hero photography and reinforce the wordmark
- Dark-navy slabs (`{colors.ink}`) close every page rhythm — testimonial bands, "how can we help?" prelude, and the footer
- Section rhythm: utility-strip → top nav → white body → cloud-band → ink slab → cloud-band → ink footer

## Colors

> **No Interaction sub-section.** Hover colors are silently filtered. Allowed sub-sections: Brand & Accent, Surface, Text, Semantic.

### Brand & Accent
- **HP Electric Blue** (`{colors.primary}` — `#024ad8`): the system's lone signal — primary CTA fill, link color, chevron-decoration fill, active sub-nav indicator. Reserved.
- **Bright Blue** (`{colors.primary-bright}` — `#296ef9`): a slightly lighter variant used inside dark slabs (testimonial-card buttons, dark-band CTA links) where the deeper blue would muddy.
- **Deep Navy** (`{colors.primary-deep}` — `#0e3191`): pressed state for the primary CTA and the visited-link color.
- **Soft Blue** (`{colors.primary-soft}` — `#c9e0fc`): pale-blue surface used inside customer-story cards and selection chips.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#ffffff`): the universal page background. White, full opacity.
- **Paper** (`{colors.paper}` — `#ffffff`): card surfaces — same white as canvas, with hairline borders or shadows providing the lift.
- **Cloud** (`{colors.cloud}` — `#f7f7f7`): the lightest gray section band, used for alternating-row backgrounds and product-feature card groups.
- **Fog** (`{colors.fog}` — `#e8e8e8`): a slightly darker gray surface band, used for FAQ outer panels and the "Trending laptops" header strip.
- **Steel** (`{colors.steel}` — `#c2c2c2`): hairline border used on outlined elements with stronger emphasis (focus states, active filter).
- **Bloom Coral / Bloom Rose** (`{colors.bloom-coral}` / `{colors.bloom-rose}` — `#ff5050`, `#f9d4d2`): the "Get 25% off" sale-tag chip + soft pink lifestyle accent on the sale hero.
- **Storm Mist / Sea / Deep** (`{colors.storm-mist}`, `{colors.storm-sea}`, `{colors.storm-deep}` — `#8ebdce`, `#7fadbe`, `#356373`): the teal-storm tones reserved for the printer-plan illustration backdrop and supporting infographic accents.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — `#1a1a1a`): the universal text color on white surfaces — headlines, body, button labels, navigation.
- **Ink Deep** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — `#000000`): pure black used for the wordmark and 1px hairline strokes around badge outlines.
- **Ink Soft** (`{colors.ink-soft}` — `#292929`): an alternate near-black used inside dark-navy slabs as a subtle textural shift.
- **On Ink** (`{colors.on-ink}` — `#ffffff`): pure white used for headline and body text on every dark-navy slab.
- **Charcoal** (`{colors.charcoal}` — `#3d3d3d`): muted body color on white surfaces — secondary descriptions, fine-print disclaimers.
- **Graphite** (`{colors.graphite}` — `#636363`): smaller-print color, used for legal lines and timestamp metadata.

### Semantic
- **Bloom Deep** (`{colors.bloom-deep}` — `#b3262b`) + **Bloom Wine** (`{colors.bloom-wine}` — `#5a1313`): error and discount-emphasis colors. The deep brick reads as "sale" or "destructive" depending on placement.
- **Storm Deep** (`{colors.storm-deep}` — `#356373`): used as a neutral status accent (e.g., printer-plan tier "Versatile" tier color).

## Typography

### Font Family

The voice is **single-family**: Forma DJR Micro (HP's bespoke geometric grotesque, fallback Arial) across every surface — display, body, button, caption. Forma DJR Micro is a wide, slightly rounded grotesque designed at small optical sizes to stay legible at UI-chrome scale. HP runs it at weight 400 for body, 500 for display headlines, 600/700 for emphasis and button labels.

The 16/14/12-px caption tier carries the catalog metadata — model numbers, spec rows, fine print — at weight 400 with a 1.4–1.5 line-height. Button labels lift to weight 600/700 with positive 0.5–1.1px letter-spacing and uppercase transform — the only place the system tracks letters.

### Principles

The typographic decision worth flagging: HP runs **weight 500 for every display size**, including the largest 72px hero headline. Most editorial systems jump to 600/700 at hero scale; HP doesn't. The result feels open and approachable rather than commanding — appropriate for a brand that sells across consumer, SMB, and enterprise audiences in the same catalog.

Forma DJR Micro's rounded-grotesque shapes do most of the warmth. There's no italic in the system except inside legal disclaimers; emphasis is carried by weight (500 → body-emphasis, 700 → caption-bold) instead.

### Note on Font Substitutes

Forma DJR Micro is proprietary (Commercial Type / Mark Caneso). Closest open-source substitutes:
- **Inter** at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 — slightly narrower than Forma DJR Micro; bump font-size by ~3% to compensate
- **Manrope** at weights 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 — closer in proportion, gentler curves; use directly with no metric adjustment
- **Roboto** at weights 400 / 500 / 700 — flatter character; use as last-resort fallback

`dgs` uses **Inter**, embedded in the binary. Manrope was tried first and read too thin at the 11–13px UI sizes the pages use; Inter's larger x-height and tabular figures hold up there.

When swapping, set body line-height to 1.4 and display line-height to 1.0 explicitly — the Forma DJR Micro line-height numbers are tight, and most substitutes default looser.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 8px. Smaller half-step at 4px. The scale is gentle — most card padding lands at 16px or 24px; section gap at 80px.
- **Tokens (front matter)**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 20px · `{spacing.xl}` 24px · `{spacing.xxl}` 32px · `{spacing.section}` 80px
- **Section padding**: `{spacing.section}` (80px) vertical between major bands on desktop; collapses to ~48px on mobile.
- **Card internal padding**: `{spacing.xl}` (24px) for product cards; `{spacing.xxl}` (32px) for promo strips and feature cards; `{spacing.md}` (16px) for compact article tiles.
- **Gutter**: `{spacing.xl}` (24px) between grid columns at desktop; `{spacing.md}` (16px) on tablet/mobile.

The 80px section gap is the universal rhythm constant — it appears between every major homepage band, between the hero and the comparison table on the printer-plan page, and between feature rows on the laptop-shop page.

### Grid & Container

- **Desktop max-width**: 1366px content container with full-bleed-on-canvas section backgrounds.
- **Hero**: a single full-width photo card (homepage and laptop-hub hero) with the headline overlay positioned upper-left or upper-right.
- **Product family grid**: 4 columns at >1200px, 3 at 1024–1199px, 2 at 768–1023px, 1 below 768px.
- **Pricing tiers**: 4 columns at >1024px, 2x2 grid at 768–1023px, single-column accordion below 768px.
- **Footer**: 5-column link grid at >1024px, collapsing to 2-column then accordion on mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace is **commercial-clean** — generous around hero photography, tight around catalog spec rows. Product cards leave breathing room above and below the photo (≥32px) so the laptop or printer reads as a hero shot rather than a thumbnail. The fine-print disclaimer regions (legal, footnote rows) tighten line-height to 1.3 and shrink type to 11–12px so the bulk of fine print stays compact.

## Tool Density

The scale above is the marketing scale — a 44px CTA, 16px body, an 80px band
between sections. The pages `dgs` serves are not that. They are workspaces: a
file tree, a map, a timeline, a graph and its key, all on screen at once,
where a row costs vertical space the reader needs for the work.

So the system has two layers. The **semantic layer** — colour, radius,
elevation, type family — is the one above, and every page uses it unchanged.
The **density layer** replaces size only, and only on these pages:

| Token | Value | Replaces |
|---|---|---|
| `--font-size-ui` | 13px | `{typography.body-md}` as the default body size |
| `--font-size-sm` | 12px | secondary rows, fields, table cells |
| `--font-size-xs` | 11px | metadata, panel headings, captions |
| `--font-size-title` | 14px | a page or panel title |
| `--line-height-ui` | 1.4 | body line-height |
| `--control-height` | 26px | the 44px button height |
| `--control-height-sm` | 24px | icon buttons and compact fields |
| `--bar-height` | 40px | the top bar's row |
| `--status-height` | 22px | the status bar's row, thinner: text only, nothing to click |
| `--row-pad-y` / `--row-pad-x` | 4px / 8px | the 24px card padding, for a list row |
| `--gap-row` | 6px | the gap between rows in a list |

What does not change: the palette, the radius scale (buttons at
`{rounded.md}`, containers at `{rounded.lg}` and `{rounded.xl}`), the
elevation levels, and the rule that `{colors.primary}` stays scarce. A dense
page earns its density by giving up size, not by giving up the language.

Touch targets are the documented exception the other way: these pages are
driven by a pointer on a desktop, so the 44×44px minimum applies to a page
built for touch, not to the workspace chrome.

## Rows: hover, selection, focus

A list row can be under the pointer, picked out for a command, and the one
being looked at, all at once, so the three are drawn as three different
things and none of them hides another:

| State | Treatment | Token |
|---|---|---|
| Hover | The row's background goes to the lightest gray. | `--hover` |
| Selected | The row's background goes to soft blue. | `--selected` |
| Selected and hovered | The same blue a step deeper — never the hover gray, which would take the selection off the row under the pointer. | `--selected-hover` |
| Focused | A band down the row's left, in the colour of the thing itself where the thing has one — the track's colour on the GPX page — widened, over the lightest gray, with the name in ink. A second wash of blue would say the same as the selection and read as one state; a band and a colour say a different thing. Where the thing's colour can be changed, that band is the colour control itself, so the colour is set where it is shown and the row needs no swatch beside the name. | the thing's own colour, `--primary` where it has none |

The trap is specificity, not colour: `.list li:hover` is more specific than a
single state class, so a rule written as `.row.selected` alone loses to it and
the selection disappears under the pointer. A selected row states its hover
itself.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Flat | No border, no shadow. | Section bands (white, cloud, fog), full-bleed photo heroes |
| 1 — Hairline | 1px solid `{colors.hairline}` (`#e8e8e8`) border, no shadow. | Outlined buttons, comparison-table cells, FAQ accordion outers |
| 2 — Soft Lift | `0 2px 8px rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.08)`. | Product cards, pricing-tier columns, customer-story tiles |
| 3 — Floating Modal | `0 8px 24px rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.12)`. | Add-to-cart drawer, mobile-nav sheet, image zoom modal |

The system is mostly flat — depth is communicated by **color contrast** (cloud-band vs. white card on the same band) rather than shadow elevation. The Soft Lift level is the workhorse for the catalog — every product tile and pricing column gets it; nothing else does. Modal-floating is rare and reserved for transient overlays.

### Decorative Depth

The system's most distinctive depth gesture is the **HP blue chevron pair** — two angular `{colors.primary}` slashes (no radius, no shadow) that sit on the left and right of the homepage hero card and the laptop-shop hero. They're not decorative noise; they're a literal echo of the HP wordmark's two parallel slashes, scaled up to architectural size. Treat them as a brand artifact, not a generic geometric flourish.

Photography on the homepage and laptop-shop pages frames product imagery inside `{rounded.xl}` (16px) containers with a soft 1px hairline. Lifestyle photography (testimonials, "How HP works for X") sits full-bleed inside dark-navy slabs without rounding.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0px | Hero chevron decorations, full-bleed photo heroes, marquee strips |
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Secondary chip backgrounds, sale-tag pills |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 3px | Default secondary CTA radius (small touch zones) |
| `{rounded.md}` | 4px | Primary buttons, secondary buttons, text inputs |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 8px | Badge pills, category-icon cards, FAQ row containers |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 16px | Product cards, pricing tiers, customer-story tiles, photo frames |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Category sub-nav tabs, search-pill input, filter chips |

The system maintains a clear two-tier philosophy: **buttons stay sharp** (4px, almost rectilinear) while **cards and photo frames stay soft** (16px). This split is the visual signature — sharp interactive elements against softer container surfaces.

### Photography Geometry

Hero photography sits in `{rounded.xl}` (16px) frames with no border. Product family thumbnails inside the laptop-grid are 1:1 (square) on a `{colors.canvas}` background, padded so the laptop is shown at ~70% of the frame. Customer-story photography uses 16:9 inside the same `{rounded.xl}` frame. There are no full-bleed circular avatars; testimonial avatars are 4px-rounded squares.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Reserve `{colors.primary}` for the primary CTA, link color, and `chevron-decoration` motif — at most twice per viewport
- Set every headline in Forma DJR Micro at weight 500 with line-height 1.0 — resist the urge to bump weight at hero scale
- Use `{rounded.xl}` (16px) for cards and photo frames; `{rounded.md}` (4px) for buttons and inputs — keep the two-tier split sharp
- Pair white `{colors.canvas}` body bands with `{colors.cloud}` (`#f7f7f7`) alternating bands; let the gray do the breathing
- Close every page rhythm with a dark-navy `{colors.ink}` slab — the "How can we help?" prelude + footer
- Set button labels in uppercase with `{typography.button-md}` (0.7px tracking) — the only place the system tracks letters
- Use Soft Lift shadow exclusively for product cards and pricing tiers — leave section bands flat
- Frame product photography inside `{rounded.xl}` containers; never use full-bleed circular masks

### Don't
- Don't introduce secondary saturated colors outside `{colors.primary}` family + the `bloom-coral` sale-tag and `storm` printer-plan accents
- Don't apply heavy material shadows — depth is via color contrast (cloud vs. white) and Soft Lift only
- Don't round buttons above `{rounded.md}` (4px); a soft 8px+ button reads as a different brand
- Don't run Forma DJR Micro below 12px — small caption at 11px is the floor
- Don't use the chevron decoration as inline noise; it is a hero-only architectural element tied to the wordmark
- Don't drop ink text opacity to create hierarchy — switch surface or shift to `{colors.charcoal}` / `{colors.graphite}` instead
- Don't replace the HP wordmark with a generic sans lockup; the wordmark is a custom mark with its own ratio

## Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile | < 480px | Single-column stack; hamburger nav; section padding drops to ~48px; hero serif scales to ~36px |
| Mobile-Large | 480–767px | Same column count; hero scales to ~44px; pricing tiers stack vertically |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | 2-column product grid; pricing 2x2; nav still full text labels |
| Desktop | 1024–1279px | 3-column product grid; 4-column pricing; full nav |
| Desktop-Large | ≥ 1280px | 4-column product grid; 1366px content max-width with full-bleed bands |

### Touch Targets

Every interactive element clears 44×44px on mobile. `button-primary` at 44px height + 24px horizontal padding meets WCAG-AAA touch target. `category-tab` at 8px 20px padding bumps to 12px 24px on touch screens. Nav-link tap areas extend invisibly beyond the text run to the full 44px row height. Sticky cart/sign-in icons in the top nav use 44×44 invisible hit boxes around their visible 24×24 glyph.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Utility strip**: stays visible on every breakpoint; dropdowns collapse into a single "Account" icon below 768px
- **Top nav**: middle category list collapses into a hamburger drawer below 1024px; the right-side Search + Sign-in + Cart stay visible
- **Hero**: stays single-column at every breakpoint; chevron decorations shrink to ~60% size on tablet and disappear entirely on mobile
- **Product family grid**: 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 column as breakpoints shrink; cards keep `{rounded.xl}` corners at every size
- **Pricing comparison table**: 4-column grid on desktop collapses to 2x2 on tablet, then stacks into individual accordion-style cards on mobile
- **Footer**: 5-column link grid → 2-column tablet → single-column accordion on mobile; HP wordmark stays flush left

### Image Behavior

Hero photography uses `{rounded.xl}` containers at every breakpoint. The chevron decorations vanish on mobile; the underlying photo card centers in the viewport. Lifestyle photography in the testimonial and "how-can-we-help" bands maintains 16:9 ratio with horizontal cropping rather than letterboxing on mobile. There are no art-direction crop swaps between desktop and mobile — the same image is used at every size.

## Iteration Guide

1. Focus on ONE component at a time; resist refactoring an entire section in one pass
2. Reference component names and tokens directly (`{colors.primary}`, `{typography.display-xxl}`, `{rounded.xl}`, `card-product`) — do not paraphrase to hex/px in prose
3. Add new variants as separate component entries (`-pressed`, `-disabled`, `-focused`); never bury state inside prose
4. Default body to `{typography.body-md}`; reach for `{typography.body-emphasis}` for run-in bolds; keep display sizes for true heading roles
5. Keep `{colors.primary}` scarce — at most two flame elements per viewport (one CTA + one chevron decoration). Three flame items in one viewport is over-saturation
6. When introducing a new section band, choose from `{colors.canvas}` / `{colors.cloud}` / `{colors.fog}` / `{colors.ink}` — six pre-defined surface modes is the entire surface vocabulary
